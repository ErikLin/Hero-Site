    <p class="why">
        They dont call her khalisi for nothing. If any charachter is truly worthy of the thrown its her. She has dragons, some of the fiercest creatures in the land, but is not a killing maniac like some other charachters in the show. She remains kind, and gentile. Oh, she's also only 13 and already ruler of sevral cities. So whats not to like about that.

    <p class="bio">

Daenerys Targaryen, sometimes called Dany by her brother Viserys, is a major character in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth seasons. She is played by starring cast member Emilia Clarke, and debuts in the series premiere.
<img class="profile" alt="Daenerys Targaryen" src="../images/danny1.jpg">
She is the only surviving child of King Aerys II Targaryen, who was ousted from the Iron Throne during Robert's Rebellion. Daenerys's mother was sent to safety on Dragonstone island just before the Sack of King's Landing, and died giving birth to her during a great storm which wrecked the remaining Targaryen fleet at anchor, earning her the sobriquet Daenerys Stormborn. She lived in exile in Essos and was a guest of Illyrio Mopatis, until she was sold into marriage by her <img class="profile right" alt="Danny" src="../images/danny4.jpg">brother to the Dothraki Khal Drogo; the two gradually fell in love, but she lost her husband and stillborn son to the manipulations of the vengeful maegi Mirri Maz Duur. Her marriage to Drogo and subsequent interaction with the Dothraki people gives her the confidence and strength to lead and the belief in herself as the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Following the death of her brother Viserys, Daenerys was left as the last Targaryen, and intends to claim the Iron Throne as her birthright. She formally styles herself as Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of Her Name.
<img class="profile" alt="danny" src="../images/danny2.jpg">
She hatched three dragons by having her petrified dragon eggs placed on Drogo's funeral pyre, before she walked into the flames to claim them. Her dragons are the first seen in the world for hundreds of years, earning her the sobriquet Mother of Dragons.[2]
<img class="profile right" alt="danny"  src="../images/danny3.jpg">
During her campaign in Slaver's Bay, she is introduced as Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.[3] â€‹She has proven herself as a leader and a conqueror through her swift and (for the most part) merciful conquests of the Free Cities of Astapor, Yunkai and Meereen.
