Elon Reeve Musk (/ˈiːlɒn ˈmʌsk/; born June 28, 1971) is a South African-born Canadian-American business magnate,[8][9] engineer,[10] inventor[11] and investor.[12][13][14] He is the CEO and CTO of SpaceX, CEO and product architect of Tesla Motors, and chairman of SolarCity.
 <img class="profile" alt="Elon Musk" src="../images/elon1.jpg">
He is the founder of SpaceX and a co-founder of Zip2, PayPal, and Tesla Motors.[15][16][17] He has also envisioned a conceptual high-speed transportation system known as the Hyperloop and has proposed a VTOL supersonic jet aircraft with electric fan propulsion.[18][19]

Musk was born June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa,[20] the son of Maye (née Haldeman), a model from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada;[21] and Errol Musk, a South African-born electromechanical engineer. He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[21][22][23][24] His paternal grandmother was British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[25][26] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in locations in South Africa.[25]

Manual of the video game Blastar
At age 10, he discovered computing with the Commodore VIC-20.[27] He taught himself computer programming and at age 12 sold the code for a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to a magazine called PC and Office Technology for approximately US$500.[28][29] A web version of the game is available online.[28][30]

Musk was severely bullied throughout his childhood, and was once hospitalized when a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs, and then beat him until he blacked out.[31]

Musk was initially educated in private education, attending the English-speaking Waterkloof House Preparatory School. Musk later graduated from Pretoria Boys High School and moved to Canada in June 1989, just before his 18th birthday,[32] after obtaining Canadian citizenship through his Canadian-born mother.[33][34]

At the age of 19, Musk was accepted into Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, for undergraduate study, and in 1992, after spending two years at Queen's University, Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania where, at the age of 24, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in physics at Penn's College of Arts and Sciences, and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Musk stayed on a year to finish his second bachelor's degree.[35] While at the University of Pennsylvania, Musk and fellow Penn student Adeo Ressi bought a 10-bedroom fraternity house, using it as an unofficial nightclub.[31] In 1995, age 24, Musk moved to California to begin a PhD in applied physics at Stanford University, but left the program after two days to pursue his entrepreneurial aspirations in the areas of the Internet, renewable energy and outer space.[29][36] In 2002, he became a U.S. citizen.
